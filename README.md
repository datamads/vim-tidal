This is a fork of munshkr's brillant Tidal Vim plugin. I changed some small bits to my preference, namely to make SuperCollider automatically open up and start in the tmux session where Tidal is running – and keep a tab open with the settings for the SuperCollider/SuperDirt server so they are easily adjustable. This way, you're up and running in a matter of seconds so you can quickly get to the nitty gritty. 

Note: You need [SCVim for this to work.] (https://github.com/supercollider/scvim)

Before going forward you need to install that first, otherwise everything is as described in [munshkr's original repo](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal) so just follow the instructions there.
